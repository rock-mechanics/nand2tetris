# Nand2tetris

## The Repository

This is my own implementation of the assignements in Nand2Tetris course from Coursera. 
You are free to reference it or take it for inspiration, but for the best of learning experience, it is not okay to copy the answers directly for your assignment.

Copying these assignments won't take you anywhere, you cannot copy the learning experiences.

## About the Course

I am currently taking the second part of the course. 

### Part 1

This is by far the best course I have taken in my life, it reveals how computer is really work, and make me realize what **abstraction** really is.

For many people, computer is magical and taken for granted somehow, but why memory can remember things. why computer can do computation magically is not intuitive. this course actually answers all these questions.

In this course, you will learn the basics of computer hardware. and how this machine can be constructed from a very **simple** buidling block.

### Advices.
* Don't try to figure out what a Nand gate is implemented. abstract it to something already availabe. 
* Don't try to figure out what a D-flip-flop is implemented, abstract it tom something already available.
> These material is omitted after careful considerations of these two amazing professors. because it is either simple to do by electrial engineer or it is not releated to the main concepts we are talking about in this class.
* Take some time to remember the interface of each chip you built, because they are built on top of each other.
* There is a reference pdf page provided about the interface, but the data format is omitted, you may take special attention to that after you have completed the chip.
* Most importantly, having fun! the course will not take you anywhere, but the learning experience will.
